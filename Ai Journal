Week 1
I used AI to remember the input formats, also to learn how to use the decimals after not coding for some time. 
I used it to pratice the f string format and relearn much of the code that I might have forgotten about in INST126

I also used it for some syntax errors that I was working on and messed up with. 
I also used it to help teach me some of the code through the for loops.
